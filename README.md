### Welcome!ðŸ‘‹

![alt text](Banner_github.png "Banner")

I'm, among many other things, a hardware engineer, maker, creator, photography-aficionado but I'm always eager to find new challenges. 
I like to build stuff and break stuff. My main motivationis that I want to know what makes it tick and why it breaks.

This github is a window to my brain.



Right now I don't have any form of patreon/ko-fi to support me because I do this as a hobby. If you want really to donate please send the money to organizations 
that really needed.
